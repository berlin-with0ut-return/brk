	<h1>what is brk?</h1>
	<div id="aboutmain">
		<p><em>brk</em> is based on the idea of the three-part habit loop discovered by researchers at MIT<sup><a href="http://news.mit.edu/1999/habits">1</a></sup> and popularized by author Charles Duhigg in his book, <em>The Power of Habit</em>.<sup><a href="https://charlesduhigg.com/how-habits-work/">2</a></sup> This theory stipulates that most of our actions are habitual, and that these habitual actions form through three components: cue, routine, and reward.</p>
		<h5>what are habits?</h5>
		<p>In psychology, habits are behavorial routines that occur subconciously and on a regular basis. This encompasses outward behavior, as well as ways of thinking.<sup><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1412711?origin=crossref&seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">3</a></sup></p>
		<p>Evolutionarily, habits are useful because they allow "offloading" of conscious processing to the subconscious processing within the basal ganglia. This allows your brain to direct attention to the most salient and novel things in your environment, rather than focus on repetitive events or details every time they occur. Over time, even complex behaviors like driving can become habitual.<sup><a href="https://www.npr.org/2012/03/05/147192599/habits-how-they-form-and-how-to-break-them">4</a></sup></p>

		<h5>the habit loop</h5>
		<p>A simple neurological loop lies at the core of any habitual behavior: a three-part sequence of cue, routine, and reward.<sup><a href="https://charlesduhigg.com/how-habits-work/">2</a></sup></p>
		<img id="blankloop" src="imgs/blank.jpg">
		<p>The <strong>cue</strong> is the trigger for a habitual behavior to start. It can be a physical object such as food, an emotion (especially negative emotions like stress or fear), or simply a particular time of day or place. The <strong>routine</strong> is the subconscious behavior triggered by the cue, and the <strong>reward</strong> is the positive reinforcement your brain receives after completing a habit.<sup><a href="https://gdt.stanford.edu/the-habit-loop/">5</a></sup></p>
		<p>Each part of the habit loop strengthens the overall habitual behavior. Over time, continued rewarding of the same routine leads the cue to become more efficient at triggering the habit, leading to more rewards, and more strengthening of the cue. In this way, habits can become extremely powerful in regulating our day-to-day behavior.<sup><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-media-psychology-effect/201705/the-habit-replacement-loop">6</a></sup></p>

		<h5>changing your habits</h5>
		<p>Because of the habit loop, building new habits and breaking old ones can be difficult. The key is to identify the parts of the habit loop applicable to your habit, and replacing the routine part of the loop with a new routine that responds to similar cues and delivers a similar reward. By replacing the routine, but delivering the same reward, your new habit loop will be reinforced in place of the old one, allowing you to quickly build and strengthen a new, better habit.<sup><a href="https://charlesduhigg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/How-to-Change-a-Habit.jpg">7</a></sup></p>

		<h5>how brk helps</h5>
		<p><em>brk</em> removes the guesswork from this process by providing you with the scientifically-backed information you need to get started immediately on changing your habit. By aggregating information on cues and rewards for common habits, and designing a personalized plan for your habit, <em>brk</em> empowers you to learn about your own habits and to jump into breaking up with whatever bad habits you have.</p>
